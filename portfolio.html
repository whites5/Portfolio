                            <p>
                                Hi, I'm Simon, a full-stack developer, I orginally studied Sport Science as my degree and have a 
                                qualification in Personal Training. For the love i have for sports i also have the same love and 
                                passion for coding and programming, I took the plunge and starting looking at how to code and have 
                                become very invested in learning and growing in this area.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am currently employeed as a Senior Test Analyst, this allows me to learn more about the coding 
                                structures and how code is implemented while i am testing the current features. This has also 
                                allowed me to learn more about the testing process and how it is implemented. which in return helps
                                me to build testing precedures that will be reborst enough for anytime I help to develop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my free time though I like to spend time with my friends and family, teach my little boy new things 
                                (he is currently 9months old and growning), go to the gym and keep myself in shape and play football at
                                the weekends with some frineds. I am also a big football fan and for my sins the team i support is 
                                Manchester United. Fun Fact about me I was scouted by Leicester Raiders for basketball and Leicester tigers
                                for rugby.
